# KiCad Templates & Libraries
## Description
This repository is a collection of KiCad PCB templates, schematic libraries, footprint libraries and 3D models of components. This repository is intended to be added as a sub-module of each PCB project so that libraries can be updated and managed independantly from the PCB project itself.
## Addition Instructions
To add this library to an existing git repo use `git submodule add http://192.168.2.202/WarriorOx/KiCad-Templates-Libraries.git PROJECT_FOLDER/KiCad-Templates-Libraries`

This will allow for the libraries to be referenced relative to the KiCad project instead of needing to be changed when used on a different computer.
